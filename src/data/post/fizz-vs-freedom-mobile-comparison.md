## Fizz vs Freedom Mobile: The Sibling Rivalry Explained

Here's something that confuses a lot of people: Fizz and Freedom Mobile are both owned by **Quebecor**.

But they're not the same carrier. They don't share towers. They target completely different markets. And honestly, they feel like totally different companies.

So which one should you pick? I've used both. Let me break down what actually matters.

## Wait, They're Both Quebecor?

Yes, but it's complicated. Here's the history:

- **Fizz** is the budget flanker brand of **Vidéotron**, Quebec's largest cable and mobile provider
- **Freedom Mobile** was originally Shaw's wireless division, which Quebecor acquired in 2023
- They operate on **completely separate networks** with different towers and infrastructure

Think of them like siblings who grew up in different houses. Same parent company, different everything else.

## Network Coverage: The Critical Difference

### Fizz Coverage Areas

Fizz runs on the **Vidéotron network**, which is strongest in:

- **Quebec** - Excellent coverage, Vidéotron's home turf
- **Ottawa and Eastern Ontario** - Solid coverage in the capital region
- **Western Canada (Beta)** - BC, Alberta, and Manitoba with ["beta" pricing](/blog/fizz-beta-western-canada-coverage)

If you're in Montreal, Quebec City, or Ottawa, Fizz's network is mature and reliable. The Western expansion is newer, so expect some growing pains.

### Freedom Mobile Coverage Areas

Freedom Mobile has its own network, primarily covering:

- **Greater Toronto Area** - Strong urban coverage
- **Southern Ontario** - Good coverage in major cities
- **Vancouver and BC** - Former Shaw stronghold
- **Alberta** - Calgary and Edmonton areas

Freedom also has a **"Nationwide" network** that kicks in when you're outside their primary zones—but this is partner network roaming with potential speed restrictions.

## Ottawa Coverage: The Head-to-Head

For Ottawa residents specifically, this is a common question: **Fizz or Freedom?**

### Fizz in Ottawa

- Uses Vidéotron's Quebec-based network extended into Ottawa
- Generally strong coverage in urban Ottawa and Gatineau
- Some users report better indoor penetration
- Coverage map shows solid LTE/5G in the core

### Freedom in Ottawa

Freedom's Ottawa coverage is... thinner. Not gonna sugarcoat it.

- Downtown is decent
- Suburbs can be spotty
- You might fall back to partner network more often than you'd like
- When the Freedom signal IS strong, speeds can be solid

**My take for Ottawa:** Fizz generally wins here. Ottawa is close to Fizz's Quebec network core, so coverage is more consistent. Freedom users report more partner-network handoffs outside of downtown.

---

## Do Fizz and Freedom Share Towers?

**No.** Despite common ownership, they operate independently:

- Fizz uses **Vidéotron towers** (Quebec-centric infrastructure)
- Freedom uses **former Shaw towers** (Ontario/Western Canada infrastructure)
- There's no tower sharing or seamless handoff between them

Now, could Quebecor eventually integrate these networks? Maybe. But as of 2025, they're separate. Don't expect free roaming between them.

## Pricing Comparison

### Fizz Pricing

Fizz lets you customize your plan:

| Data      | Price (approx) |
| --------- | -------------- |
| 1GB       | $26/mo         |
| 4GB       | $32/mo         |
| 10GB      | $42/mo         |
| Unlimited | $50/mo         |

_Plus your My Rewards discounts reduce these over time_

### Freedom Mobile Pricing

Freedom offers fixed plans with promos:

| Data      | Price (approx) |
| --------- | -------------- |
| 10GB      | $24/mo (promo) |
| 25GB      | $34/mo (promo) |
| 50GB      | $44/mo (promo) |
| Unlimited | $50/mo         |

**Note:** Freedom frequently offers aggressive promotional pricing, especially for new customers. Their "Big Gig" plans are often cheaper than Fizz at list price, but Fizz's rewards reduce costs over time.

## Features Comparison

### Fizz Exclusive Features

- **Data Rollover (2 months)** - Unused data carries forward
- **Data Gifting** - Share data with other Fizz users

- **Community Points** - Get rewarded for helping others

### Freedom Exclusive Features

- **F&F Discount** - Friends and Family plan savings

---

## Call Quality and Reliability

Both carriers use **VoLTE** for calls, but experiences vary:

### Fizz Call Quality

- Good in Quebec and Ottawa
- VoLTE whitelist means some phones don't work
- Users generally report clear calls when coverage is good

### Freedom Call Quality

- Can be inconsistent, especially in Ottawa and fringe areas
- When on "Nationwide" partner network, call quality may differ
- Some users report dropped calls in transition zones

**Real talk:** Neither carrier is as bulletproof as Bell, Rogers, or Telus. If crystal-clear call quality is mission-critical for your job, you might want to look at the Big Three or their premium flankers (Koodo, Fido, Virgin). But for most people? Both Fizz and Freedom are fine.

## FAQ: Fizz vs Freedom Mobile

### Do Fizz and Freedom use the same network?

No. Despite both being owned by Quebecor, they use separate network infrastructure. Fizz uses Vidéotron towers; Freedom uses former Shaw towers.

### I live in Ottawa/Gatineau. Which signal is better?

Fizz (Videotron) usually wins here. Fizz runs on the native Videotron infrastructure which covers both Ottawa and Gatineau seamlessly. Freedom Mobile has towers in Ottawa, but signal often drops or switches to "Roaming" when you cross the bridge into Gatineau. For National Capital Region commuters, Fizz is generally more stable.

### Can I use Fizz across Canada?

Fizz works in Quebec, Ottawa, and Beta areas (BC, Alberta, Manitoba). Outside these zones, you'll roam on partner networks with potential restrictions.

### Is Freedom cheaper than Fizz?

At promotional prices, Freedom often beats Fizz. But Fizz's recurring My Rewards discounts can make it cheaper over time.

### Does Fizz do a credit check like Freedom Mobile?

No. Fizz is 100% prepaid, so there is no credit check (hard or soft). You just link a card and pay. Freedom Mobile generally requires a hard credit check (Equifax) for their monthly postpaid plans, which can impact your credit score. If you want to avoid a credit hit, Fizz is the safer choice.

### Do both carriers support Wi-Fi Calling (VoWiFi)?

No. Freedom Mobile supports Wi-Fi Calling, which is a lifesaver if you live in a basement or thick concrete building with poor signal. As of late 2025, Fizz does not officially support Wi-Fi Calling. If you rely on Wi-Fi for calls at home, Freedom is the better technical option.

### Which is better for US travel: Freedom or Fizz?

It depends on your style. Freedom often includes US/Mexico roaming in their base plans ("Roam Beyond"), so it works automatically. Fizz requires you to manually change your plan coverage to "Canada + USA" in your account (which takes effect the next billing cycle) or buy an add-on. Freedom is more convenient; Fizz is more flexible if you only travel once a year.

### Which has better customer support?

Both are self-serve with chat and community forums. Neither offers phone support. Fizz's community is more active due to gamification.
