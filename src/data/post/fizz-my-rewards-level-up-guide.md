## What is Fizz My Rewards?

Alright, this is the fun part. Fizz doesn't just give you a cheap plan and call it a day. They gamify the whole thing.

The **My Rewards** program lets you earn points, unlock badges (yes, like a video game), and claim **recurring discounts** that actually lower your bill every single month. It's weirdly addictive once you get into it.

I've been playing the game for a while now. Here's how to level up fast and squeeze every perk out of the system.

> **Need a head start?** Use code **HN9SM** to kickstart your rewards journey with a **$40 bonus**.

## How the My Rewards System Works

The program has three core components:

1. **Points** - Earned through various activities
2. **Levels** - Your rank based on total points earned
3. **Upgrade Slots** - Where you apply your recurring rewards

As you level up, you unlock more upgrade slots, meaning you can stack more monthly discounts and data bonuses.

## How to Earn Points (All Methods)

Points come from a bunch of different sources. Some are passive (just pay your bill). Others take a little hustle.

### Paying Your Bill

| Activity                  | Points           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Pay monthly mobile bill   | 25 points        |
| Pay monthly internet bill | 25 points        |
| First payment (mobile)    | 250 bonus points |
| First payment (internet)  | 250 bonus points |

Nothing to do here. Just... keep paying. Points roll in automatically. Easy money. Well, easy points.

### Referrals

| Referral Type                | What You Get                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Friend signs up for mobile   | One-time bonus credit + 250 points |
| Friend signs up for internet | One-time bonus credit + 250 points |

Referrals give you a **one-time credit** plus points toward leveling up. The points help you unlock upgrade slots faster—and THAT's where the recurring monthly discounts come from.

### Community Participation

| Activity                     | Points          |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| Answer accepted by community | 10-50 points    |
| Best answer selected         | Bonus points    |
| Earn a badge                 | Varies by badge |

The Fizz forum is gamified—helping others earns you points toward leveling up.

### Badges

Badges are achievements for specific actions:

| Badge Type      | Example             | Points |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| Getting started | Complete profile    | 10-50  |
| Payment         | Pay first bill      | 100+   |
| Referral        | First referral      | 100+   |
| Community       | Answer 10 questions | Varies |
| Loyalty         | 1 year as customer  | Bonus  |

## How to Level Up Fast

### Strategy 1: Refer Everyone You Know

Seriously. This is the move.

Each referral gives you a **one-time bonus credit** plus points that help you level up faster. Faster leveling = more upgrade slots unlocked = more recurring discounts available. The referral itself is one-time, but it accelerates your path to permanent savings.

Your code to share: **HN9SM** (or grab your own from your dashboard after signup). Learn more in our [complete referral guide](/blog/fizz-referral-code-guide).

### Strategy 2: Get Both Mobile and Internet

Having both services doubles your monthly point income:

- Mobile: 25 points/month
- Internet: 25 points/month
- First payments: 500 bonus points combined

If you need home internet anyway, might as well get it from Fizz and stack those rewards.

### Strategy 3: Actually Help People in the Forum

The Fizz community forum rewards good answers:

- Answer someone's question
- If they accept your answer, you get points
- "Best answer" status = bonus points

**Tip:** Sort by "newest" questions. Fewer competing answers means better odds yours gets picked.

### Strategy 4: Don't Sleep on Easy Badges

A lot of people skip these. Don't be them.

- Complete your profile
- Enable autopay
- Download the app
- Verify your email

These take like 5 minutes total. Free points.

### Strategy 5: Just... Stick Around

Fizz rewards tenure:

- 6 months = bonus points
- 12 months = even more
- Anniversary badges are chunky

Patience pays. Literally.

## Understanding Upgrade Slots

**Upgrade slots** are where you apply your rewards. Each slot holds ONE upgrade (data bonus or dollar discount).

| Your Level | Slots Available |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Level 1-2  | 1 slot          |
| Level 3-4  | 2 slots         |
| Level 5-6  | 3 slots         |
| Level 7-8  | 4 slots         |
| Level 9-10 | 5 slots         |

### How to Apply Upgrades

1. Go to **My Account** → **My Rewards**
2. View available upgrades
3. Click on an upgrade to preview it
4. Assign it to an available slot
5. Upgrade applies to next billing cycle

### Upgrade Examples

- **+1GB monthly data** - Extra data every cycle
- **$2/month off** - Recurring bill discount
- **+2GB bonus data** - Larger data pools
- **$3/month off** - Higher-tier discount

### Can You Change Upgrades?

Yes! You can swap upgrades between billing cycles. Review your options monthly to optimize.

## Referral Bonuses vs My Rewards

These are related but different:

| Type               | What You Get                   | How Applied                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Referral Bonus     | Recurring $$ off (e.g., $2/mo) | Applied automatically to bill |
| My Rewards Upgrade | Data or $$ from reward slots   | You choose and assign         |

**Both stack!** A Level 6 user with 3 referrals might have:

- $6/month from referral bonuses (3 × $2)
- $3/month from upgrade slots
- Total: $9/month in recurring discounts

---

## The Best Upgrades to Choose

So you've got upgrade slots. What do you pick?

Here's my priority order:

1. **Dollar-off discounts** - These save you real money. Every month. Forever.
2. **Large data bonuses** - Good if you burn through data consistently
3. **Smaller data bonuses** - Fine if you have light months

**Quick math:**

- $2/month off × 12 months = $24/year. Guaranteed.
- 1GB bonus data? Only valuable if you actually USE it.

Most people should grab the dollar discounts first. Data bonuses are nice, but they don't compound the same way.

---

## Fizz Rewards for Internet Customers

Home internet users get separate rewards:

- Points for internet payments (separate from mobile)
- Internet-specific upgrades (e.g., speed boosts are rare but exist)
- Dollar discounts apply to your internet bill

If you have BOTH mobile and internet, you might unlock more slots faster.

## FAQ: Fizz My Rewards

### How do I check my level and points?

Log into fizz.ca → My Account → My Rewards → View your level, points, and available upgrades.

### Do points expire?

No. Points don't expire. Your level is based on lifetime accumulated points.

### Can I lose levels?

No. Once you reach a level, you keep it. You can't lose points or drop levels.

### What's the highest level?

Currently Level 10, though Fizz may add more in the future. Most long-term, active users reach Level 8-10 within 1-2 years.

### Do upgrades carry over if I change plans?

Yes. Your rewards and upgrades stay with you if you change plan tiers or add/remove features.

### Can I transfer points to another account?

No. Points are tied to your account and can't be transferred.

### Why can't I unlock a 4th upgrade slot?

There is a hard limit of **3 slots per plan**. You unlock them at Level 1, Level 3, and Level 5. Even if you reach Level 10, you will never get a 4th slot. Higher levels simply give you better rewards (e.g., swapping a $1 discount for a $2 discount) to put into your existing 3 slots.

### Do my upgrades really expire after 24 months?

Officially, yes. Fizz terms state upgrades are valid for 24 months from the date you receive them. However, many "OG" users from 2019 report their upgrades have persisted indefinitely. Treat 24 months as the guaranteed minimum, but you might get lucky and keep them forever.

### What earns the most points: Referrals, Billing, or Forum?

Referrals are the fastest shortcut.

- **1 Referral = 200 points** (Instant)
- **Paying Bill = 10 points per $1 spent** (Slow & steady)
- **Forum Answer = 3 points** (or 5 points if answered in <5 mins)

You would need to answer ~67 forum questions to equal just one referral.

### How do I earn 5 points instead of 3 on the forum?

Speed matters. If you answer a question on the Fizz Community Hub within **5 minutes** of it being posted, you earn **5 points** instead of the standard 3. This is why you see users "camping" the Newest Questions tab to answer immediately.

---

## Bonus: Hidden Tips for Faster Leveling

1. **Refer during promo periods** - Fizz often increases referral bonuses to $40+, giving you more points
2. **Answer questions on weekends** - Fewer active forum helpers means your answers are more likely to be accepted
3. **Stack services** - Mobile + Internet = 2× billing points per month
4. **Don't sleep on badges** - Many users miss easy badges worth hundreds of points
