## Fizz Goes West: What is Beta Service?

Fizz has expanded beyond Quebec. If you're in **British Columbia, Alberta, or Manitoba**, you can now sign up for Fizz mobile.

But here's the catch: it's labeled "Beta."

That word makes some people nervous. Is it stable? Will it work? Is the price too good to be true?

Short answer: it's fine for most people. Longer answer: keep reading.

---

## What Does "Beta" Mean for Fizz?

Beta is Fizz's way of saying: "We're still building out this market."

### What Beta Includes

- ✅ Full mobile service (calls, texts, data)
- ✅ Same plans and features as Quebec
- ✅ **Discounted beta pricing** (up to 50% off in some cases)
- ✅ Access to My Rewards program
- ✅ Data rollover and gifting

### What Beta Might Mean

- ⚠️ Coverage might be patchier than in Quebec (where Fizz is rock solid)
- ⚠️ Fewer local towers means more reliance on partner networks
- ⚠️ Customer support may know less about your specific area
- ⚠️ Network improvements are still happening

**The honest take:** Beta doesn't mean broken. It means "early adopter pricing with some rough edges." I've talked to folks in Vancouver and Calgary using it daily. Works fine. Just don't expect the polish of Fizz in Montreal.

---

## Current Beta Coverage Areas

As of late 2025, Fizz Beta is available in:

### British Columbia

- ✅ Vancouver and Greater Vancouver Area
- ✅ Victoria
- ✅ Kelowna
- ⚠️ Smaller cities: Coverage varies

### Alberta

- ✅ Calgary
- ✅ Edmonton
- ✅ Red Deer
- ⚠️ Rural areas: Mixed coverage

### Manitoba

- ✅ Winnipeg
- ⚠️ Brandon and smaller cities: Check coverage map

### Ontario (Beta Expansion)

- ✅ Southern Ontario (GTA, Hamilton, London)
- ✅ Ottawa (already established)
- ⚠️ Northern Ontario: Limited

---

## Beta Pricing: Is It Actually Cheaper?

Yes. Beta pricing is Fizz's incentive to get early adopters despite the "beta" label.

### Example Beta Pricing (approximate)

| Plan      | Regular Price | Beta Price |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| 4GB       | $34/mo        | ~$17-25/mo |
| 10GB      | $44/mo        | ~$25-35/mo |
| Unlimited | $55/mo        | ~$35-45/mo |

_Actual beta pricing varies by region and promotional periods_

### Will Beta Pricing Last?

This is the million-dollar question. Honestly? Fizz hasn't officially stated when beta pricing ends.

But here's what we know:

- Users who sign up during beta **might get grandfathered** into their rate when it goes official
- Fizz has a track record of honoring legacy pricing for loyal customers
- No guarantees though—read the terms

**The smart move:** Lock in beta pricing now if you're in a covered area. Worst case, if prices increase and you don't like it, just switch. No contracts.

> **Signing up for Beta?** Don't forget to use referral code **HN9SM**. Even on beta plans, you get the **$40 bonus**.

## Real-World Coverage Reviews

### Vancouver Area

**User reports:**

- Strong LTE/5G in downtown Vancouver
- Good coverage on SkyTrain routes
- Some dead spots in deep buildings
- BC Ferries: Expect router-based Wi-Fi, not cellular

**The verdict:** Usable for daily driving. Similar to [Freedom Mobile's coverage](/blog/fizz-vs-freedom-mobile-comparison) in the area.

### Calgary

**User reports:**

- Solid coverage in downtown and main residential areas
- Works well on C-Train
- Some gaps in newer suburbs
- Indoor coverage varies by building

**The verdict:** Most users report positive experiences. Check specific neighborhoods before committing.

### Edmonton

**User reports:**

- Good urban coverage
- LRT corridor works well
- Rural trips outside the city: Partner network kicks in
- Generally reliable for everyday use

### Winnipeg

**User reports:**

- Downtown and central areas covered
- Some suburban gaps
- Smaller Manitoba cities: Very limited

## Subscription Area vs Coverage Area

This confuses a lot of people. Here's the distinction:

### Subscription Area

Where you **live** and sign up from. To get Fizz, your home address must be in a valid subscription area:

- Quebec
- Ottawa/Eastern Ontario
- BC, Alberta, Manitoba (Beta)
- Southern Ontario (Beta)

### Coverage Area

Where your phone **actually works**. Fizz provides coverage through:

- Their own network (best speeds)
- Partner networks (when roaming within Canada)

**Example:** You can sign up in Vancouver (subscription area) and travel to Toronto. Your phone will work on partner networks, but you can't sign up from Toronto unless it's a covered subscription area.

## What About the Fizz Internet in Western Canada?

As of 2025, **Fizz Home Internet is NOT available in Western Canada**. It's only in Quebec, where Fizz uses Vidéotron's cable infrastructure.

Western Canada has different cable providers (Shaw, Telus, etc.), so Fizz Internet expansion would require new partnerships.

**Mobile only for now** in BC, AB, and MB.

---

## Should You Switch to Fizz Beta?

### Switch if you:

- ✅ Live in a Beta coverage area (check the map)
- ✅ Want to lock in discounted beta pricing
- ✅ Are comfortable with occasional coverage gaps
- ✅ Primarily stay in urban areas
- ✅ Already have an unlocked, VoLTE-compatible phone

### Don't switch if you:

- ❌ Need bulletproof rural coverage
- ❌ Travel frequently to areas not covered
- ❌ Require carrier support via phone (Fizz is self-serve only)
- ❌ Have a phone not on Fizz's VoLTE whitelist

---

## How to Check Coverage in Your Area

Before signing up:

1. Visit [fizz.ca](https://fizz.ca)
2. Enter your address in the coverage checker
3. Look at the coverage map for your neighborhood
4. Check both LTE and 5G availability

**Pro tip:** Ask on Reddit (r/FizzMobile) for real-world experiences in your specific city. Coverage maps don't always tell the full story.

## FAQ: Fizz Beta in Western Canada

### Is Fizz Beta reliable for daily use?

In major urban areas (Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg), yes. Expect occasional issues in fringe areas or deep inside buildings.

### Can I use Fizz in Saskatchewan or other provinces?

You can **use** Fizz while traveling (via partner networks), but you can't **sign up** unless your address is in a subscription area.

### How do I know if my phone works on Fizz Beta?

Check Fizz's VoLTE compatibility list. Dial #8378 after inserting your SIM to test connectivity.

### What happens if Fizz never officially launches?

Unlikely given Quebecor's investment, but if Fizz pulled out: You'd port your number to another carrier. No long-term contract locks you in.

### Will my beta pricing be grandfathered after launch?

While Fizz hasn't made an official guarantee, their history in Quebec suggests yes. Early adopters who signed up during previous betas were grandfathered into their low rates for years. Many users sign up now specifically to lock in this potential "price for life."

### Can I get Fizz Home Internet in BC or Alberta?

No. Currently, Fizz Home Internet is only available in Quebec and parts of Ontario. It relies on the Videotron cable infrastructure, which does not exist in Western Canada.

### What is the "3-Month Partner Network" usage policy?

Fizz has a policy where if you use your service primarily on partner networks (Fizz EXT) for 3 consecutive payment cycles, your data may be blocked. However, this targets users living permanently outside subscription areas (like Saskatchewan). If you live in a valid Beta zone (like Vancouver or Calgary), you generally don't need to worry.

### Does Fizz Beta have 5G?

Yes, in supported areas. Coverage is expanding, but 5G availability varies by city. If you don't get 5G, your phone will fall back to LTE, which is still very fast.
