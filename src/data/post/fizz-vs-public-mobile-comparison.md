## Fizz vs Public Mobile: The Battle of the Budget Carriers

Let's skip the fluff. You're here because you want cheap mobile service that doesn't suck, and you've narrowed it down to two options: Fizz or Public Mobile.

Both are "flanker" brands. Fizz is owned by Vidéotron (Quebecor). Public Mobile runs on the Telus network. Both are budget-focused. Both skip the retail stores.

So which one deserves your money? I've dug through the fine print so you don't have to.

## Network Coverage: Where Can You Actually Use It?

### Fizz Coverage

Fizz runs on the **Vidéotron network**, which means excellent coverage in:

- Quebec (primary strength)
- Ottawa and Most of Ontario
- **Beta coverage** in BC, Alberta, and Manitoba (partial coverage)

If you live in Quebec or Ottawa, Fizz's network is rock solid. It is quite good in most of Ontario. The Western Canada expansion is still in "beta," which means pricing is discounted but coverage is a bit discounted as well.

### Public Mobile Coverage

Public Mobile piggybacks on the **Telus network**, one of Canada's Big Three. This gives you:

- Coast-to-coast coverage across Canada
- Strong rural coverage
- Reliable service even in smaller towns

**The verdict:** If you're in Quebec or Ottawa, Fizz wins on local network quality. If you need nationwide coverage or travel frequently across Canada, Public Mobile has an edge.

## Rewards Programs: Dollar-Off vs Points

Both carriers have loyalty programs. But they work VERY differently.

And spoiler: one is clearly better imo

### Fizz My Rewards: Stability You Can Count On

Fizz's gamified loyalty program gives you **permanent dollar-off discounts** that stack over time:

- Earn points by paying bills, answering community questions, and referring friends
- Unlock "upgrade slots" as you level up
- Apply monthly discounts like "$2 off forever" or bonus data
- **Referrals give bonus credits** plus points to level up faster

**Key benefit:** The upgrade slot discounts are **recurring**. Get a $2/month discount at Level 5, and you keep it every month going forward. Combine this with one-time referral credits and you're maximizing your savings. Check our [complete My Rewards guide](/blog/fizz-my-rewards-level-up-guide) to see how fast you can level up.

**Fizz My Rewards stability** is a major selling point. The program hasn't been "devalued" or restructured. You keep what you kill or rather earn.

### Public Mobile Rewards: The Points Controversy

Public Mobile recently revamped their loyalty program to a **points system**:

- Earn points for autopay, referrals, and tenure
- Redeem points for discounts or data
- Value has been decreased compared to the old system

**Public Mobile loyalty program changes** caused major community backlash:

| What Changed     | Old System            | New System             |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| AutoPay discount | $2/mo automatic       | Points you must redeem |
| Referral bonus   | $1/mo recurring       | One-time points        |
| Tenure bonus     | Stacked automatically | Points-based           |

**The catch:** Many long-time Public Mobile users felt burned when the new points system replaced their legacy AutoPay discounts. There's ongoing frustration in the community about "reward devaluation." Users who had built up $5-6/month in legacy discounts saw their savings restructured. Maybe this will happen to Fizz but I don't think it will for a long time.

**Fizz Rewards vs Public Points value:**

- Fizz: A $2/month discount = $24/year. Forever. No action required. Set and Forget
- Public Mobile: Points you have to actively redeem. Value fluctuates. Need to spend time managing points.

**My take:** Fizz's recurring dollar-off rewards are more valuable long-term. Public Mobile's points system is fine, but it's less predictable and requires more time management. If you want "set it and forget it" savings, Fizz wins this round.

## US Roaming: Where Fizz Shines

This is where Fizz really stands out. If you travel to the US even occasionally, pay attention.

### Fizz US Roaming

Fizz uses a **wallet-based system** for roaming:

- Add money to your Fizz Wallet
- Pay per MB or buy travel add-ons
- Only pay for what you use
- Add-ons range from small (500MB) to large (multi-GB)

**Fizz US travel data rates:**

- Pay-as-you-go: ~$0.05-0.10/MB from your wallet
- 500MB add-on: ~$15
- 1GB add-on: ~$25
- 3GB add-on: ~$45

**Best for:** Short trips, variable travel schedules, or anyone who hates paying for unused data.

### Public Mobile US Roaming: The 15-Day Problem

Public Mobile offers **fixed 15-day roaming bundles**:

- $15 for 1GB US data (15 days)
- $25 for 2GB US data (15 days)
- $35 for 3GB US data (15 days)
- Must activate bundle before traveling

**Public Mobile 15-day roaming vs Fizz wallet** - here's the real comparison:

| Scenario                       | Fizz Cost | Public Mobile Cost | Winner   |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| 3-day weekend trip, 500MB used | ~$15      | $15 (1GB bundle)   | Tie      |
| 1-week trip, 1GB used          | ~$25      | $15-25             | Tie      |
| 2-week trip, 2GB used          | ~$35      | $25                | PM       |
| Two 3-day trips same month     | ~$30      | $30 (2 bundles)    | Tie      |
| Quick 1-day shopping trip      | ~$5-10    | $15 minimum        | **Fizz** |

**The problem with Public Mobile:** If your trip is 3 days, you're still paying for 15 days of coverage. Zero flexibility. And if you make two short trips in a month? You're buying two separate 15-day bundles.

### Cheapest US Roaming for Short Trips

If you're looking for the **cheapest US roaming for short trips**, Fizz wins hands down:

- **Day trip to Buffalo?** Use $5-10 from your wallet
- **Weekend in Vermont?** ~$10-15 total
- **Quick border shopping?** A few bucks at most

With Public Mobile, even a 4-hour shopping trip to Plattsburgh costs you the full $15 bundle price.

**The verdict:** Fizz is usually better on US roaming flexibility. Overall if you travel a lot to the US I would pick a US/Canada roaming plan which is offered by many carriers and neither Fizz or Public Mobile are the obvious choice in this regard. In fact, there are usually good deals around black friday end of year which might be better than Fizz or Public Mobile.

## Pricing Comparison

Both carriers are budget-focused, but Fizz's customizable plans offer a lot more choices.

### Fizz Plan Examples

| Data      | Minutes/Texts | Price   |
| --------- | ------------- | ------- |
| 1 GB      | Unlimited     | ~$21/mo |
| 4 GB      | Unlimited     | ~$25/mo |
| 10 GB     | Unlimited     | ~$29/mo |
| 70 GB     | Unlimited     | ~$39/mo |
| Unlimited | Unlimited     | ~$45/mo |

_Prices vary based on customization and rewards applied_ (December 2025 prices)

### Public Mobile Plan Examples

| Data  | Minutes/Texts | Price  |
| ----- | ------------- | ------ |
| 1 GB  | Unlimited     | $20/mo |
| 8 GB  | Unlimited     | $30/mo |
| 10 GB | Unlimited     | $35/mo |
| 70 GB | Unlimited     | $40/mo |

**Note:** Public Mobile's prices are often promotional. Always check current offers.

## Data Rollover and Gifting: Fizz's Killer Features

### Data Rollover

Unused data on Fizz **rolls over for 2 months**. Got a 5GB plan but only used 3GB? That extra 2GB carries forward. And Fizz uses your **oldest data first**, so nothing expires unnecessarily.

Public Mobile? No rollover. Use it or lose it.

### Data Gifting

This one's fun. Fizz lets you **gift data to other Fizz users**:

- Gift to family members instead of everyone paying for bigger plans
- Swap with strangers on Reddit or the Fizz forum
- Once gifted, that data leaves your account permanently

Public Mobile doesn't do this at all.

**My take:** If your data usage varies month to month—heavy some months, Fizz's rollover and gifting make your plan way more flexible. You're not throwing away unused data.

---

## Customer Support: Both Are Self-Serve

Neither Fizz nor Public Mobile offers traditional phone support. It's all digital:

- **Fizz:** Chat support + community forum (gamified with points)
- **Public Mobile:** Chat support + community forum

The Fizz community is notably active because users earn loyalty points for answering questions. Public Mobile's community is helpful but less motivated.

## If you prefer calling someone, neither carrier is for you. Consider Koodo or Virgin instead for cheaper prices with some service.

## Who Should Choose Fizz?

Fizz is the better choice if you:

- ✅ Live in Quebec, Ontario, or Fizz Beta coverage areas (BC, AB, MB)
- ✅ Travel to the US occasionaly
- ✅ Want data rollover and gifting features
- ✅ Value long-term recurring discounts
- ✅ Are comfortable with 100% self-serve support

## Who Should Choose Public Mobile?

Public Mobile is the better choice if you:

- ✅ Need nationwide Telus coverage
- ✅ Live in rural areas outside Quebec/Ontario
- ✅ Want straightforward, no-frills pricing
- ✅ Don't care about data rollover
- ✅ Are comfortable with 100% self-serve support

## FAQ: Fizz vs Public Mobile

### Which has better coverage in rural areas?

Public Mobile (Telus network) generally has better rural coverage outside Quebec. Fizz's strength is urban Quebec, Ottawaand the GTA.

### Can I keep my phone number when switching?

Yes. Both carriers support number porting. Request the port during signup.

### Do either offer unlimited data?

Both offer unlimited data plans at their higher tiers. Fizz throttles after your high-speed allotment; Public Mobile similarly manages congestion.

### Which rewards program saves more money?

Fizz's My Rewards is generally superior for long-term users because it offers recurring dollar-off discounts (e.g., $2/mo off forever). Public Mobile uses a Points system where you earn points to redeem for one-time bill credits. Fizz's "set it and forget it" discounts often add up to more savings over time.

### Can I buy a phone from Public Mobile?

No. Public Mobile is strictly Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). They do not sell phones. Fizz sells both new and "Preloved" (refurbished) phones and offers financing (Affirm). If you need a new device with your plan, Fizz is your only option here.

### Which is better for weekend trips to the US?

Fizz wins here. Public Mobile forces you to buy a 15-day roaming bundle (minimum ~$15) even for a 24-hour trip. With Fizz, you can load $5 into your Wallet and pay per MB/minute, costing you a fraction of the price for short cross-border hops.
